This is going to be a recipe page.
The meal is going to be a Cast Iron pan-seared Steak.
I am going to write the standard HTML boilerplate.
I am also going to use headings <h#>, paragraph <p>, Anchor <a>, ordered/unordered list <ol>/<ul>,<li> and image element <img> and neccesary text for context towards this page.
