            <h2>Beatifully made juicy steak</h2>

            <p>If you're making steaks inside, you've come to the right place. This technique for cooking steak in a cast iron skillet is unbeatable.
             What sets it apart? It starts on the stove in a cast iron skillet, but you'll finish the steak in the oven. The stovetop-to-oven method produces
              steaks with a deeply caramelized crust and a tender, perfectly cooked interior.</p>
